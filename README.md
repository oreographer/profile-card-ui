# Profile Card UI

## Overview

This script dynamically injects a CSS stylesheet and creates a profile card UI element on a webpage. The profile card displays personal information, skill set, and contact details, and includes social media links.

## Features

- **CSS Injection**: Injects an external CSS stylesheet for styling the profile card.
- **Profile Card**: Creates and displays a profile card with sections for "About," "Skill Set," and "Contact."
- **Interactive Buttons**: Allows users to navigate between different sections of the profile card.
- **Social Media Links**: Includes links to various social media profiles.
- **Close Button**: Provides functionality to close the profile card.

## Usage

### Inject CSS

The `injectCSS` function creates a `<link>` element and appends it to the document's `<head>` to include the stylesheet.

### Show Profile Card

The `showProfileCard` function creates and inserts the profile card HTML into the document's `<body>`. It initializes event listeners for navigation buttons and manages section visibility.

### Close Profile Card

The `closeProfileCard` function removes the profile card from the document's `<body>`.

## Functions

- `injectCSS()`

- `showProfileCard()`

- `closeProfileCard()`

## Example

<script src="path/to/this/script.js"></script>
<script>
